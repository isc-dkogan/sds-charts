 Comparing the sample that we were given to follow, the sds helm templates differ significanlty from what is generated by helm create. In some cases, the changes really don't seem to make sense or fit within the conecpet of a template.

  - SDS changes the way the image is defined. It seperates registry into registry and repository and also removes the conditional clause of using image.tag to override the version. The latter is particularly bad because the values.yaml file still contains the comment which said that it will be used as an override even though the template was changed

  - The templates reuse the same string over and over(6 times in the deployment) without declaring it as a variable?
